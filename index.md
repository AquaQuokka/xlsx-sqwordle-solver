# Header 1
Sqwordle is like Wordle for Pokefans.
... but with 905 possibilities, it can get hard ...
Does it have to be, though?

I can give you reasons why it shouldn't be hard.

- This Sheet engine will give you hints at what to guess next based on unique letter usage, and common letters. We used a Scrabble tile-like system for this.
- In the current beta testing, the engine has been extremely helpful.
