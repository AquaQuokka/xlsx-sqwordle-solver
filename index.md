## Welcome to XLSX Sqwordle Solver engine!



# Header 1
Sqwordle is like Wordle for Pokefans. <br>
... but with 905 possibilities, it can get hard ... <br>
Does it have to be, though? <br>
<br>
I can give you reasons why it shouldn't be hard. <br>
<br>
- This Sheet engine will give you hints at what to guess next based on unique letter usage, and common letters. We used a Scrabble tile-like system for this. <br>
- In the current beta testing, the engine has been extremely helpful. <br>
