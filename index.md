## Welcome to XLSX Sqwordle Solver engine!



# Sqwordle
Sqwordle is like Wordle for Pok√©fans. <br> <br>
... but with 905 possibilities, it can get hard ... <br> <br>
Does it have to be, though? <br> <br>
<br> <br> <br>
I can give you reasons why it shouldn't be hard. <br>
<br>
- This Sheet engine will give you hints at what to guess next based on unique letter usage, and common letters. We used a Scrabble tile-like system for this. <br>
- In the current beta testing, the engine has been extremely helpful. <br>
<br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
However, until further and more thorough testing has been completed, and more QOL features have been added, the project will remain in a closed alpha state. <br> <br>

But I still kindly thank you for your interest! <br> <br>

Ta, AquaQuokka <br> <br> <br>
